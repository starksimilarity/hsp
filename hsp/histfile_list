# Config file for defining which histories to load

# Format is: historyfile:historyfile_type
# if there are underscores in the historyfile, the loader will attempt
# to apply username_hostID_date_ignored to the history when those fields
# aren't explicitly labeled in the history

# historyfile_type is an optional field that helps the loader determine 
# which format the historyfile is in
# Valid formats include: msf_prompt, pickle

#stark_host3_20191025_2:msf_prompt
#histfile:pickle
#bash_hist_example:bash_hist
csv_hist_example:generic_csv_hist
#SavedPlayback_201911111542:pickle
